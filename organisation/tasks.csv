1;Setup a task file;Organisation;A task file is to be set up to mimic a very basic ticket system.;;Done
2;Setup GitHub pipeline;Organisation;A basic GitHub pipeline should be created to validate pushed code.;;Done
3;Implement input sensor;Feature;The input mechanism needs to be generified to a genomic component.;;
4;Implement output sensor;Feature;The output mechanism needs to be generified to a genomic component.;;
5;Allow configuration of constant size organisms;Feature;The binary size calculation of organisms is performed on every update cycle and might pose a performance bottleneck for organisms that have a constant size at runtime. A configuration should be introduced to allow size calculations to be performed only once. It should be disabled by default to prevent accidental memory growth for arbitrary implementations.;;
6;Implementation of simple neuronal networks;Feature;Simple neuronal network components need to be integrated into / natively supported by the framework.;;
7;Replace random function with distribution trait;Feature;All random functions defined in interfaces need to be replaced with the native Distribution trait to allow easier code maintainability.;;
