1,Setup a task file,Organisation,A task file is to be set up to mimic a very basic ticket system.,,Done,
2,Setup GitHub pipeline,Organisation,A basic GitHub pipeline should be created to validate pushed code.,,Done,
3,Implement input sensor,Feature,The input mechanism needs to be generified to a genomic component.,,Done,29.12.2021
4,Implement output sensor,Feature,The output mechanism needs to be generified to a genomic component.,,Done,15.02.2021
5,Allow configuration of constant size organisms,Feature,The binary size calculation of organisms is performed on every update cycle and might pose a performance bottleneck for organisms that have a constant size at runtime. A configuration should be introduced to allow size calculations to be performed only once. It should be disabled by default to prevent accidental memory growth for arbitrary implementations.,,,
6,Implementation of simple neuronal networks,Feature,Simple neuronal network components need to be integrated into / natively supported by the framework.,,Done,20.04.2022
7,Replace random function with distribution trait,Feature,All random functions defined in interfaces need to be replaced with the native Distribution trait to allow easier code maintainability.,,,
8,Update libraries,Feature,All libraries should be updated to their most recent version if possible without major issues.,,Done,13.12.2021
9,Remove crossover for usize,Bugfix,The gene module implements the CrossOver trait for usize in a module specific way. This will make custom networks using usize as the information type unusable.,,,
10,Change mutations to a list of trait objects,Feature,Mutations are currently implemented as a typ, which hinders custom implementaitons of mutation lists. Implementing mutations as a list of functions does not interfere with serialisation of the network as mutations are only applied at runtime and not conserved elsewise.,Done,06.01.2022
11,Adjust substrates after gene removal,Bugfix,GeneSubstrates need to be adjusted after gene removal, but are currently only adjusted after GeneSubstrate removal.,,
12,Switch mutex implementaiton to parking_lot,Feature,The parking_lot crate is the defacto standard for asynchronous types and all usages of Mutex should be replaced accordingly.,,,
13,Add more input and output sensors for neural networks,Feature,Additional input and output sensors for neural networks should be implemented to allow broader application of those networks.,,,
